				About a year and a half ago ago was the first time that I went to the gym. However, I have consistently gone just about everyday for the last five months, with probably a handful of days I actually skipped to rest. My routine is a legs, push, pull split repeated twice, and one day of cardio. The gym makes me feel better and is one of my favorite hobbies.

				I started golf about four years ago after I was cut from the baseball team. My freshman year I was on jv golf and since then I have played on varsity for my sophomore, junior, and senior years. I am currently golf captain and hope to win a league title this upcoming season. I love the sport because of both its mental and physical demands.

				</p>
				<p>
				I spend around one-fourth of my day listening to music. I specifically, sway towards the genre of rap and hip-hop. Some of my favorite artists include Travis Scott and Lil Uzi Vert. They put me in a great mood whether I am just studying at home, at the gym, or just driving in my car. I could not imagine my life without music. It betters my day and my whole attitude.
