				I have known my mom for about 17 years now. We met on June 18, 2001. I love my mom and appreciate everything she does for me. She is currently retired and spends most of her time caring for my grandpa and doing other mom things. I would not be the person I am today without my mom.

Jose is the oldest and currently works as a music producer and owns his own company. My brother Frisco manages his company. I love them very much.
